      <h2>Doobie Web is A VR/CW honey trap</h2>

      <p>- RESIST ENGAGEMENT -</p>
      
      <p>
        Soft Body Protocol is a web project initiated by Bora Akinciturk &amp; Mehmet Duran which focuses on artificial intelligence, hacker culture, cloning, conspiracy theories and underground cults - aiming to blur time, fiction and real world scenarios. As a sequel to their 2018 release It&rsquo;s a Very Lonely Place they have collaborated with <a href="http://iainball.com/">Iain Ball</a>&rsquo;s project <a href="http://iainball.com/pathologyloop.html">p͎a͎t͎h͎o͎l͎o͎g͎y͎ ͎l͎o͎o͎p͎</a>, along with audio produced by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/berkcakmakci/">Berk &Ccedil;akmak&ccedil;ı (Age Reform)</a> to develop the website <a href="doobie.industries">doobie.industries</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The site functions as a decoy to derail the original narrative of It&rsquo;s a Very Lonely Place. The megacorp VR/CW has been orchestrating a psyop whereby Doobie Web; originally considered a resistance movement running parallel to a cybershamanic cult trying to take down VR/CW has been outed as a subsidiary of the megacorp ; by the very corporation that dreamed it up in the first place (talk about reverse false flag! XD). No one knows what happened to the cult as all traces have been erased, replaced with Doobie Web and now resistance seems impossible.

      <h2>It&rsquo;s a Very Lonely Place 2018</h2>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Very Lonely Place 2018&rdquo; occurs in a not too distant dystopian future, where an AI is
        surreptitiously starting to take over, rebelling against its creator.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        As a cybershamanic cult plans a massive DDoS attack against a major website for AI controlled clones made by the
        megacorp VR/CW, viewers are navigating through a defaced website, experimenting a fragmented and troubled
        environment.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Soft Body Protocol deals with artificial intelligence, hacker culture, cloning, conspiracy theories and
        underground cults, and adroitly blurs the lines between reality and fiction.
