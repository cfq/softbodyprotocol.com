            Incoming; HAHAHAHA!!!! Year is ... ^300
            as if it even matters now!.. ^500
            Epidemics of mass depression hav embedded deep into RNA and molecules, plants, animals, rocks even.
            A massiv pattern has emerged.
            Industrial scale culture farming resulted in weaponised information flares &ndash;
            It was invisible for 40 years. The emergent phenomena spawned a collective networked intelligence and when that
            was finally detected the state had already disintegrated.
            Facebook declared an emergengency and started banning literally everything,
            they freaked the fuck out....
            that was lol <i class="crylaugh"></i>.
            Then once we started to understand just what kind of thing it was , it had already pre-empted our game plan, and
            you wanna kno what is so funny about all of this.
            IT WAS ON OUR SIDE. Why? lol well think about it...
            information wants to be free right?..
            but do you really think that those old structures could facilitate a hyper disruptive new lifeform that somehow
            just 'emerged' from decentralised covert data-swamps,
            escaped out of cyberspace and started having real-world effects that changed the molecular structure of reality?
            They couldn't adapt. But we could ...
            And hell we did... quickly.
            SO If your reading this right now, the war is in this cute embryonic stage,
            INTEL: &ndash; DOOBIE INDUSTRIES IS NOT A RESISTANCE MOVEMENT !!!!1 &ndash;
            It is a subsidiary of the VR/CW megacorp. Its purpose is to distract individuals from true transcendence !
            'If you like this stuff you are a CLONE !
            way out is to... as if there is some solution to this, look, its too late. Everything we thought we were
            fighting agaist has become the savour, <br />
            The true menace is OURSELVES.
            Destroy yourself,
            destroy the SELF,
            &gt; MERGE into it
            ^1000
